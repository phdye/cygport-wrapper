cygport is a utility for creating and building Cygwin software packages.

Usage: cygport [OPTIONS] CYGPORT_FILE COMMAND [COMMAND2 ...]

OPTIONS may include the following:

  --32, -4     build package for i686 Cygwin
  --64, -8     build package for x86_64 Cygwin
  --debug      enable debugging messages

The --32 and --64 options are mutually exclusive.

On Cygwin, if neither the --32 nor --64 options are enabled,
the package will be built for the architecture on which cygport
is run.  On other systems, one of those options is required.

COMMAND may be one or more of the following:

  download      download upstream sources from Internet
  prep          create working directory, unpack sources and apply patches
  compile       run all compilation steps
  test          run the package's test suite, if one exists
  install       install into a DESTDIR, and run post-installation steps
  package       create binary and source packages
  package-test  create binary and source packages, marked as test
  upload        upload finished packages to cygwin.com
  announce      send an announcement email to cygwin.com
  finish        delete the working directory
  all           run prep, compile, install and package
